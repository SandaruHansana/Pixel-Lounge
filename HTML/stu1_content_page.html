            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious
                of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a horror film envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude
                and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008. The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. Inception was
                filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22. Its official budget was $160 million, split between Warner Bros. and Legendary. Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure
                the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.

            <h2 class="heading">Plot Summary</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Dom Cobb, a skilled thief, is on the run from the law and is unable to return to his family in the United States. He is offered a chance to redeem himself by a wealthy businessman named Saito, who wants him to perform an "inception" on a target named
                Robert Fischer. Inception involves planting an idea in someone's mind, a feat that is considered almost impossible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To accomplish the task, Cobb assembles a team of specialists, each with a unique skillset. Arthur is his partner and provides logistical support. Eames is a forger and impersonates people in dreams. Yusuf is a chemist who develops the sedatives required
                for the team to enter multiple levels of dreaming. Ariadne is a young architect who creates the complex dreamscapes that the team must navigate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As they enter Fischer's dreams, the team realizes that the task is more difficult than they imagined. They must navigate through multiple levels of Fischer's subconscious, each one more dangerous than the last. Meanwhile, Cobb is haunted by the memories
                of his dead wife, who appears in his dreams and threatens to sabotage the mission. The team faces a race against time, as the deeper they go into Fischer's mind, the more unstable the dream world becomes, and the risk of being trapped
                in it forever increases.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="heading">Visual Effects</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="paragrph">
                For dream sequences in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring practical effects whenever possible. Nolan said, "It's always very important to me to do as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics
                are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically. To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes
                place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time.".
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragrph">
                The most challenging effect was the "Limbo" city level at the end of the film, because it continually developed during production. Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: "Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture,
                but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs". Franklin and his team ended up with "something that looked like an iceberg version of Gotham City with water running through it." They created a basic model of a glacier and
                then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then
                they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct DiCaprio and Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin
                had created. Inception had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, Batman Begins had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects
                shots.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="heading">Music</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The score for Inception was written by Hans Zimmer, who described his work as "a very electronic, dense score", filled with "nostalgia and sadness" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film. The music was written simultaneously to filming, and features
                a guitar sound reminiscent of Ennio Morricone, played by Johnny Marr, former guitarist of the Smiths. Édith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" ("No, I Regret Nothing") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and
                Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score. A soundtrack album was released on July 11, 2010, by Reprise Records. The majority of the score was also included in high resolution 5.1 surround sound on the second disc of the
                two-disc Blu-ray release. Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Score category in 2011, losing to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of The Social Network.
