            <br>
            <p class="paragraph"> RRR is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan,
                Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It centers around fictional versions of two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their
                friendship, and their fight against the British Raj. Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The
                film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few
                sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer
                whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects. Made on a budget of ₹550 crore (US$72 million), RRR is the most expensive Indian film to date. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which was postponed
                multiple times due to production delays and the COVID pandemic.</p>
            <br>
            <p> RRR was released theatrically on 25 March 2022. With ₹240 crore (US$30 million) worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra
                Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹415 crore (US$52 million). The film grossed ₹1,200 crore (US$150 million) – ₹1,258 crore (US$160 million) worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, including the third highest-grossing
                Indian film and second highest-grossing Telugu film worldwide. RRR received international praise for Rajamouli's direction, writing, performances (particularly Rama Rao and Charan), soundtrack, action sequences, cinematography and visual
                effects.
            </p>

            <p> The film was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the list. The song "Naatu Naatu" won the Best Original Song award at the
                95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Indian film, as well as the first from an Asian film, to win in this category. The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe
                Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Indian (as well as the first Asian) nomination to win the award. RRR also won the Best Foreign Language Film and the Best Song
                award at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards.
